            <h1>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h1>
            <p><span class="abt-span1">I used to be a pack rat.</span>  I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the 
                 truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. 
                 Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in,
                  and I couldn't hold a relationship. </p>
                  <h1>How I turned things around </h1>
                  <p><span class="abt-span1"> I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</span>I literally put 90% of my possessions in the 
                   garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. It wasn't
                    easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else 
                    to do. And it worked.</p>
                    <h1> Now I live the simple life</h1>
                    <p> Now that I'm living a simple life,
                     things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more
                      free time to enjoy. With how much it turned my life around,<span class="abt-span1">
                        I felt like I had no choice 
                      but to start sharing how I did it </span> , and how others can benefit from living a simple life as 
                      well, which is why I started this site!</p>
